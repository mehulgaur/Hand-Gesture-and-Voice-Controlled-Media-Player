# Hand-Gesture-and-Voice-Controlled-Website

Designed a user-friendly website that responds to hand gestures and
voice commands to help people with disabilities navigate the system
and control the media player.

Developed the hand gesture model using Python's Mediapipe library
and integrated it into the website using the Flask Framework.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to construct the website's core,
and voice commands were integrated with the Annyang JavaScript
module.

Functionalities include volume control, jump to timeframe, fullscreen and complete navigation.
